Welcome to the unofficial Boglebot service!

Your Boglebot financial advisor will help you to help you set an asset allocation for your investments and (in a future release) see how your portfolio performs.

How much money (in your currency) will you invest?

What country do you pay your taxes to? This is typically your tax residency but if you are a US person then choose US.
*choice
  #Hong Kong/Singapore
    Great! No capital gains or dividend taxes to worry about
    *finish
  #Australia
    There are many local specific concerns as well as specialist Australia funds provided by companies such as Vanguard. The boglebot does not yet have the expertise to advise on this special situation

  #Japan
      Due to favorable tax treaties with the US, you can invest in US domiciled ETFs just like a US person.

  #United States
      *label usperson
    Unfortunately, helping US persons is beyond the boglebot! There are many guides on the internet for US investing. Go choose one of those These pages are aimed at non-US individuals

  #Other country
    I don't have specific advice for other countries as yet. See
    *link https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Nonresident_alien%27s_ETF_domicile_decision_table
    for general advice. Since I don't know any better, I will assume you don't have a favourable tax treaty with the US on both dividend witholding taxes and estate taxes. Therefore, recommendations will be limited to Ireland domiciled ETFs that have favourable treatment. For investments under 60,000 USD, your country may have other reasonable options.

This boglebot recommends your equity allocation be passively allocated across the entire world, weighted by global market capitalization

We'll then help you find the low cost ways of achieving this

For now, we assume you have 0% tax on dividends and 0% tax on capital gains and are affected by the typical 30% withholding tax on US dividends

    #Passive index funds
        Great choice! Passive funds are recommended by Bogleheads due to their low cost
 
        *goto etfchoice
    #Actively managed funds
        Actively managed funds have higher fees than passive funds. Are you sure you wish to proceed with choosing an active fund?
        *choice
            #Yes - active funds
                You invest your money in an active fund. 20 years later you realise that the odds of an active fund outperforming a passive index fund iess less than 1%. You enter your retirement in regret

We assume you will use exchange traded funds (ETFs) to create your portfolio

What type of ETF shall we go for?

*choice
    #Global index fund
        *goto globalindex
    #Local market index fund
        By concentrating to just your local market, you are not really diversifying your portfolio and are leaving yourself with high concentration risk in the single country of your choice
        
        *goto etfchoice
    #Follow the most popular ETF sectors
        ETFs that target specific portions of the market have typically higher costs compared to passive global index trackers. But trying to follow what is popular is a common strategy
        *choice
            #Proceed with following ETF trends
                You invest in yourself like an average investor. Over time, this is how you did compared to just to sticking with passive funds

For equities, there are these recommended ways of buying the global market, depending on what you prefer

A single ETF fund that covers the global market, run by a company owned by ETF share owners, thus acting in your best interests. Vanguard also offer a lower cost option if you can manage two ETFs

Based on the largest most popular ETF in its class, run by a profit making company but requires you to manage two ETFs

Based on the cheapest ETF in its class, run by a profit making company, also requiring you to manage two ETFs

    #Single fund (recommended)
        Then I recommend the Vanguard FTSE All World ETF. The fund has an expense ratio of 0.22%, There are accumulating and distributing options.
        
        *goto globalindex
    #Most popular fund
        The iShares Core MSCI World ETF (IWDA) is the most popular ETF in its class, covering the developed world. In order to cover the global market, one also needs to cover emerging markets so you'll also need to invest in the iShares Core MSCI EM IMI (EIMI) ETF. You'll need to invest in these two funds in approximately an 88/12 proportion to match global market cap ratios. The funds will have a combined expense ratio of about 0.20%
        
        *goto globalindex
    #Cheapest Vanguard fund
        Vanguard has arguably the best reputation in the market for having customer interests before profits due to its corporate structure. They consistent lower their expenses when they can. The funds will have a combined expense ratio of about 0.14%
        *goto globalindex
    #Cheapest fund
        The SPDR MSCI World ETF (SWRD) is a relatively new ETF that is the cheapest in its class, covering the developed world. In order to cover the global market, one also needs to cover emerging markets so you'll also need to invest in the iShares Core MSCI EM IMI (EIMI) ETF. You'll need to invest in these two funds in approximately an 88/12 proportion to match global market cap ratios. The funds will have a combined expense ratio of about 0.13%.

  #Vanguard cheap combo - Vangurard Developed World + Emerging Market (TER 0.14%)
      Splitting the All-World index into separate Developed World and Emerging Market funds works out cheaper - but you'll have two funds to manage.

Bonds are typically used to stabilize the value of a portfolio and/or produce a stream of income. Longer-term bonds have higher correlation with equities; shorter-term bonds provide more diversification benefit but lower yield.

This bot will recommend global bonds hedged back to your local spending currency. This is based both on my opinion and that of Vanguard's: 
*link https://personal.vanguard.com/pdf/ISGGLBD.pdf

Another sensible option is to use your local government bonds, assuming your government issues high credit quality bonds. (e.g. GBP, EUR, JPY)

What is the currency you spend most in?

*choice
  #USD - US Dollars
    Dollars it is! Recommendation is to use an ETF that tracks the Global Aggregate Bond Index, hedged to USD.
    
    Here are two sensible choices. The most popular and liquid option is from iShares. Vanguard has also launched a relatively new option for those that prefer Vanguard. Both options have a TER of 0.1%
    
    *choice
        #iShares AGGU - Accumulating (most popular)
            The ETF AGGU is an iShares fund that covers global bonds and is hedged to USD.

  #GBP - UK Pounds Sterling
    Sterling it is! . Recommendation is to use an ETF that tracks the Global Aggregate Bond Index, hedged to GBP.
    
    Here are three sensible choices. The most popular and liquid option is from iShares. Vanguard has also launched a relatively new option for those that prefer Vanguard. All options have a TER of 0.1%
    
    1) The iShares AGBP
    *link http://www.morningstar.co.uk/uk/etf/snapshot/snapshot.aspx?id=0P0001C9YI iShares Global Aggregate Bond UCITS 
    from iShares is the most popular and is a Distributing fund
    
    2) The Vanguard VAGS ETF is an Accumulating fund
    
    3) The Vanguard VAGP ETF is a Distributing fund
    
    *choice
        #iShares AGBP
            *set bondname "AGBP - iShares Core Global Aggregate Bond (GBP Hedged)"
            *set bondter 10

  #EUR - Euro
    Euro it is! The Boglebot offers 3 choices for a global bond fund that is hedged back to EUR. Note that unlike the rest of the Boglebot recommended funds, the following choices are not found on the London Stock Exchange. You'll need access to local European exchanges.
    
    1) The ETF AGGH is an iShares fund that is the [b]largest[/b] global bond fund that is hedged to EUR. (Recommended due to popularity)
    
    2) The ETF VAGF is a relatively [b]new[/b] Vanguard ETF and is [b]accumulating[/b]
    
    3) The ETF VAGE is a relatively [b]new[/b] Vanguard ETF and is [b]distributing[/b]
    
    All above choices track the same Barclays global bond index and have the same 0.10% expense ratio so there isn't much to choose between them
    
    *choice
      #AGGH - iShares Accumulating ETF
        On the Borsa Italiana and SIX Swiss exchange, the ticker symbol is AGGH. On the popular German Xetra exchange, the symbol is [b]EUNA[/b]. They are all the same underlying fund, it just depends on your broker and exchange.

  #Other
    I don't know of bond etfs hedged to your currency. You may look at local currency bond options. I can only suggest
    *choice
      #USD - It is the strongest currency available and safest to hedge to
        *set bondname "AGGU iShares Core Global Aggregate Bond (USD Hedged)"
        *set bondter 10

    In that case, your global bond portfolio does not need hedging to any currency. The ETF AGGG is an iShares fund that covers global bonds.
    *set bondname "AGGG iShares Core Global Aggregate Bond (Unhedged)"
    *set bondter 10

The bond portion of your portfolio is set to

*stat_chart
  percent bonds ${bondname}

*temp cost ((bonds*eqter)*amount)/1000000

The fund manager will earn 0.${bondter}% a year on your equity portfolio, which works out to ${cost} a year

I can recommend 4 general bond index strategies for consideration

[b]1) Global Aggregate Bond (AGGG variants) [/b]

Barclays global index that includes govts and corporates with credit ratings from AAA to BBB. This is the most diversified bond portfolio (and thus recommended)


[b]2) Global Govt Bond (IGLO variants)[/b]

Like 1) but without the corporates - Governments only. By being higher grade than 1), it may have better inverse correlation with your equity portfolio (i.e. help diversify your portfolilo as a whole)


[b]3) Global AAA-AA (IAAA variants)[/b]

Like 2) but only high grade bonds, thus excluding governments like Italy.


[b]4) Local only government bonds[/b]

Some efficient market theory says obtaining the risk free rate of interest won't matter if it is local or globally but hedged back. Thus if you can get purely local currency bonds at lower cost, you may save on expense fees.

The above is for your eduction. The Boglebot doesn't presently allow you to choose them. (Sorry). To continue, the main recommendation here is AGGG.

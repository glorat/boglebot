What next?

Boglebot suggestions are based on simple low cost funds with simple choices. Theyl save greatly on expenses compared to most other "professional" portfolios that get you on fees.

However, they do not take into account all your personal circumstances so it is worth getting second opinions. Where can you get more personalised help for free?

What country do you pay your taxes to? This is typically your tax residency but if you are a US person then choose US.
*choice
  #Hong Kong/Singapore
    Great! No capital gains or dividend taxes to worry about
    *finish
  #Japan
      Due to favorable tax treaties with the US, you can invest in US domiciled ETFs just like a US person.

  #United States
      *label usperson
    Unfortunately, helping US persons is beyond me! There are many guides on the internet for US investing. Go choose one of those These pages are aimed at non-US individuals

  #Other country
    I don't have specific advice for other countries as yet. See *link https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Nonresident_alien%27s_ETF_domicile_decision_table
    for general advice. Since I don't know any better, I will assume you don't have a favourable tax treaty with the US on both dividend witholding taxes and estate taxes. Therefore, recommendations will be limited to Ireland domiciled ETFs that have favourable treatment.
